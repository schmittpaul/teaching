# 449 title

## Instructor
Paul Schmitt

pschmitt \[at\] hawaii.edu

## Details
This is a course designed for students who have an interest in academic
research as well as students who seek to develop creative systems
problem-solving skills that are necessary for the next generation of engineers
and developers. We will take a tour of a variety of contemporary research
topics, with an eye towards not only learning something about the individual
topics, but also dissecting what makes for successful solutions. Networked
systems privacy and security is quite broad, which is one of its appeals -
privacy/security issues arise in any area, and privacy/security is difficult. 

## Textbooks
There are no required texts. Papers and various resources will be provided
throughout the semester.

## Prerequisites 
Prior coursework in networking and operating systems or consent of the
instructor.

## Requirements

The class will focus on topics in computer privacy and security. You will need
to read papers prior to class, and be engaged in discussions. 

- Class participation: 20%
- Security reviews: 10%
- Project proposal: 10%
- Project reviews: 20%
- Project: 40%

The project will be the biggest piece of this class as the class is designed to
be an introduction to research in computer privacy and security. Projects can
be in small groups that will depend on final enrollment. I will update the
schedule with information on due dates.

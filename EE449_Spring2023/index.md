# Computer Communication Networks

## Instructor
Paul Schmitt

pschmitt \[at\] hawaii.edu

## Details
It is hard to think of a technology that has more changed the way we live than the Internet. From the very way we communicate, access and exchange information, shop, pay, move, entertain, maintain friendship. At the same time, the Internet is inexorably growing, at an always faster pace: from 3 billion of connected hosts in 2015 to an estimated 4 billion in 2019.

At the end of this course, you will be able to:

1. understand how the Internet works: from your laptop to Google's datacenter at the other end of planet;
2. build and operate an Internet-like network infrastructure;
3. identify the right set of metrics to evaluate the performance or the adequacy of a network and propose ways to improve it (if any).

## Textbooks
We will use the textbook [Computer Networking: A Top-Down Approach (6th Edition) by Kurose and Ross](http://www.amazon.com/Computer-Networking-Top-Down-Approach-6th/dp/0132856204/) as a reference and as a source of examples. Older versions of the book are fine too but sections number won't necessarily match.

## Prerequisites 
Pre: 315 and one of 342, or MATH 371 or MATH 471; or consent.

## Requirements

The class will focus on topics in computer privacy and security. You will need
to read papers prior to class, and be engaged in discussions. 

- Class participation: 20%
- Security reviews: 10%
- Project proposal: 10%
- Project reviews: 20%
- Project: 40%

The project will be the biggest piece of this class as the class is designed to
be an introduction to research in computer privacy and security. Projects can
be in small groups that will depend on final enrollment. I will update the
schedule with information on due dates.

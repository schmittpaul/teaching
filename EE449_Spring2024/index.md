# Computer Communication Networks

## Instructor
Paul Schmitt

pschmitt \[at\] hawaii.edu

## Details
It is hard to think of a technology that has more changed the way we live than the Internet. From the very way we communicate, access and exchange information, shop, pay, move, entertain, maintain friendship. At the same time, the Internet is inexorably growing, at an always faster pace: from 3 billion of connected hosts in 2015 to an estimated 4 billion in 2019.

At the end of this course, you will be able to:

1. understand how the Internet works: from your laptop to Google's datacenter at the other end of planet;
2. build and operate an Internet-like network infrastructure;
3. identify the right set of metrics to evaluate the performance or the adequacy of a network and propose ways to improve it (if any).

## Textbooks
There is no required text for this course. For reference, I will use the textbook [Computer Networking: A Top-Down Approach (8th Edition) by Kurose and Ross](https://www.pearson.com/en-us/subject-catalog/p/computer-networking/P200000003334/9780135928615) as a source of examples. We may also periodically use materials from the freely available [Computer Networks: A Systems Approach](https://book.systemsapproach.org/#).

## Prerequisites 
Pre: EE 315 and one of EE 342, or MATH 371 or MATH 471; or consent.

## Grading

All assigned work is due by 11:59pm on their selected days. If you submit your work late, we will give you credit for it according to this scale:

- 80% for work submitted up to 1 day late;
- 70% for work submitted up to 2 days late;

## Policies
All work you do in this class must be *your own*. Talking with each other is perfectly fine, copying/pasting code or answers from the Internet is not acceptable, and will be handled harshly. Use of LLMs such as ChatGPT to craft answers is not accepted in this course - the point is to see whether you understand the topic.

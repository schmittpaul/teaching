## Project

The main goal of this course is to get you engaged in high quality research. As
such, the main portion of your grade will be tied to a semester-long project.
See this [PDF](papers/EE693F%20Project.pdf) for a discussion of project and
deliverables. It may still be updated, ask me if you have questions.
